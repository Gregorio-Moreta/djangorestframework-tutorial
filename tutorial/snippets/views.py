# PART 3 OF TUTORIAL CLASS BASED VIEWS Using mixins
# One of the big wins of using class-based views is that it allows us to easily compose reusable bits of behaviour.

# The create/retrieve/update/delete operations that we've been using so far are going to be pretty similar for any model-backed API views we create. Those bits of common behaviour are implemented in REST framework's mixin classes.

# Let's take a look at how we can compose the views by using the mixin classes. Here's our views.py module again.
# Importing the necessary modules and classes
from snippets.models import Snippet  # Importing the Snippet model from the snippets.models module
from snippets.serializers import SnippetSerializer  # Importing the SnippetSerializer class from the snippets.serializers module
from rest_framework import mixins  # Importing the mixins module from the rest_framework package
from rest_framework import generics  # Importing the generics module from the rest_framework package

# Defining a class called SnippetList
class SnippetList(mixins.ListModelMixin,  
                  # The class inherits from the ListModelMixin class from the mixins module.  This mixin provides the behavior for retrieving a list of objects.
                  mixins.CreateModelMixin,  
                  # The class also inherits from the CreateModelMixin class from the mixins module. This mixin provides the behavior for creating a new object.
                  generics.GenericAPIView):  
                  # The class also inherits from the GenericAPIView class from the generics module. This is a generic view class that provides the base functionality for handling HTTP requests.

    # A queryset is created by retrieving all Snippet objects from the databaseThis line creates a queryset by retrieving all Snippet objects from the database. The Snippet.objects.all() expression retrieves all instances of the Snippet model.
    queryset = Snippet.objects.all()

    # Assigning the SnippetSerializer class to the serializer_class attribute
    # Here, the SnippetSerializer class is assigned to the serializer_class attribute of the SnippetList class. This indicates that the Snippet objects should be serialized and deserialized using the SnippetSerializer.
    serializer_class = SnippetSerializer

    # This block defines a get method to handle HTTP GET requests. When a GET request is received, it delegates the handling of the request to the list method, which is provided by the ListModelMixin class. This method retrieves a list of Snippet objects and returns the serialized representation of the objects.
    # Defining a GET method to handle HTTP GET requests
    def get(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        # Delegates the request to the list() method
        return self.list(request, *args, **kwargs)


    # This block defines a post method to handle HTTP POST requests. When a POST request is received, it delegates the handling of the request to the create method, which is provided by the CreateModelMixin class. This method creates a new Snippet object based on the provided data and returns the serialized representation of the created object.
    # Defining a POST method to handle HTTP POST requests
    def post(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        # Delegates the request to the create() method
        return self.create(request, *args, **kwargs)
# We'll take a moment to examine exactly what's happening here. We're building our view using GenericAPIView, and adding in ListModelMixin and CreateModelMixin.

# The base class provides the core functionality, and the mixin classes provide the .list() and .create() actions. We're then explicitly binding the get and post methods to the appropriate actions. Simple enough stuff so far.

class SnippetDetail(mixins.RetrieveModelMixin,
                    mixins.UpdateModelMixin,
                    mixins.DestroyModelMixin,
                    generics.GenericAPIView):
    queryset = Snippet.objects.all()
    serializer_class = SnippetSerializer

    def get(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        return self.retrieve(request, *args, **kwargs)

    def put(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        return self.update(request, *args, **kwargs)

    def delete(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        return self.destroy(request, *args, **kwargs)
# Pretty similar. Again we're using the GenericAPIView class to provide the core functionality, and adding in mixins to provide the .retrieve(), .update() and .destroy() actions.

# This all works as intended because the mixin classes provide the action methods .get(), .post(), .put(), and .delete(). We're then binding the appropriate http methods to the actions.




# CHATGPT questions
# explain some examples of what these arguments can be used for

# request: The HTTP request object containing information about the incoming request.
# *args: Variable-length positional arguments. These are additional arguments that can be passed to the method.
# **kwargs: Variable-length keyword arguments. These are additional keyword arguments that can be passed to the method.

# CHATGPT ANSWER
# Certainly! Here are some examples of what these arguments can be used for:

# 1. `request`:
# The `request` argument represents the HTTP request object, which contains information about the incoming request. It provides access to various attributes and methods that can be useful for processing the request. Examples of what can be done with the `request` object include:
# - Accessing request headers, such as `request.headers['Content-Type']`.
# - Accessing request data, such as `request.data` in Django REST Framework, which provides access to the parsed request payload.
# - Retrieving query parameters, such as `request.GET['param_name']` to access a specific query parameter.

# 2. `*args` (positional arguments):
# The `*args` parameter allows for variable-length positional arguments to be passed to the method. This can be useful when you want to accept an arbitrary number of positional arguments without specifying them explicitly. Examples of how `*args` can be used include:
# - Accepting multiple values, such as `def my_method(*args):` where `args` will be a tuple containing all the passed positional arguments.
# - Iterating over the arguments, such as `for arg in args:` to process each argument individually.

# 3. `**kwargs` (keyword arguments):
# The `**kwargs` parameter allows for variable-length keyword arguments to be passed to the method. This provides flexibility in accepting additional named arguments without specifying them explicitly. Examples of how `**kwargs` can be used include:
# - Accepting and processing optional parameters, such as `def my_method(**kwargs):` where `kwargs` will be a dictionary containing the passed keyword arguments.
# - Accessing specific keyword arguments, such as `value = kwargs.get('param_name', default_value)` to retrieve a specific argument with a default value if it is not provided.
# - Passing additional arguments to other functions or methods, such as `self.some_method(**kwargs)` to forward the keyword arguments to another method.

# In summary, the `request` argument provides access to information about the incoming HTTP request. The `*args` parameter allows for variable-length positional arguments to be passed, and `**kwargs` enables passing variable-length keyword arguments. These arguments provide flexibility and customization options when handling requests and allow for generic or flexible method signatures that can accommodate different scenarios.
